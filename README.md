<h1><b>Document Retrieval using Turicreate</b></h1>
<p>In this project, I have implemented the concept of Document Retrieval to find who is closest to a person based on data from wikipedia.</p>

<p>To get started download the SFrame used by this project from here: https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/-q2dp-IAEemnvhJSBz-0XA_9625a0851f91403da0239b66c8e2bed8_people_wiki.sframe.zip?Expires=1648425600&Signature=ef9F5TYDYeH3cpmP9PoT3zcKrL0BnkJKPSsWB2rRdy-XZCvcuK~rh1ifU3NyRe3jRA4leNkl4yjrzEHo3siq7g6Vq2Fjq-p61YK5u4vzbLR4gddDypPsl5oxJa2JcMy4qakDficNCjYFyM6n69gqIDPl8dIZ~NpCSAZ4M1yIdK8_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A.</p>

<p>Unzip the folder obtained from the link and locate the file called as m_cf05efad0f89a530.0000.Then move this file to the folder people_wiki.sframe that is present in the same folder as this README.md file.</p>

<p>Next follow the instructions in the jupyter notebook and carry on. Thank You. Referred from Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach from Coursera.</p>
